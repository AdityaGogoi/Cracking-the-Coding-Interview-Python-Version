# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-Python-Version
This repository contains solutions from Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
It also contains notes taken from the book and other tutorials to build the foundation of every topic before diving into the questions.
The format is in Ipython Notebook which is not ideal for execution but is great for reading on a subject that needs revision in case of an interview.

I am reading an older version of this book so this repo may not cover every question in the book.
